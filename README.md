# Welcome to ZFKC project
This project regards a php connector written in zend framework style for [KcFinder](http://kcfinder.sunhater.com// "KCFinder").
The original project (server side) was designed in a manner that was not possible to manage privileges at user level. This connector instead makes this possible and is integrated upon ZF infrastructure.
 
This project reflects the [demo site](http://zfkc.ovum.it/ "jump to zfkc.ovum.it") but the mosto important code (regarding only the connector) can be found on these files:

- lib/My/Controller/Action/Helper/Kcfiles.php
- lib/My/KcFinder/Router.php
- application/controllers/KcController.php
- application/views/scripts/kc/*
